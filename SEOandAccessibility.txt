SEO and Accessibility Write-Up:

The site is organized to meet Search Engine Optimization Standards by including meta information in the head of every page. 
This information includes the name of the author (myself), keywords, and a description. All this information makes it 
so it is easier to research the website on a browser. I also used HTML semantics (i.e. <section> to improve SEO). 
In regards to creating a website that is accessible, I included the role of the navigation bar, main, and sections, and also
included a video description for the video. Furthermore, on the contact page I included label descriptions for the 
text entry boxes and the submit button.
